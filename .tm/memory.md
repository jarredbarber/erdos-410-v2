## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T20:59 UTC (Heartbeat #1)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 (main theorem only) | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 1 in_progress, 0 closed | Build: ✅ compiles
**Status**: Cold start — bootstrapped project infrastructure and seeded initial advisor task.
**Observations**:
- Project was blank template: Erdos/Basic.lean had `def hello := "world"`, no proofs/ directory
- Set up theorem statement with correct imports (needed rpow via Analysis.SpecialFunctions.Pow.Real)
- Build succeeds with 1 sorry (the main theorem)
- Created initial advisor task (erdos410v2-u2o, priority 0) for gap analysis and task decomposition
- Worker picked it up immediately — now in_progress
- Problem is Erdős #410: iterated σ_k(n)^{1/k} → ∞ for n ≥ 2
**Actions**:
1. Wrote theorem statement into Erdos/Basic.lean with correct Mathlib imports
2. Created proofs/README.md (literature directory)
3. Committed both (build passes)
4. Created advisor task for initial planning (erdos410v2-u2o)
**Watch next**:
- Did the advisor task complete and create explore/formalize sub-tasks?
- Are workers picking up the new tasks?
- Is the decomposition reasonable? (expecting sub-goals like σ(n) ≥ n+1, growth bounds, etc.)

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T21:15 UTC (Heartbeat #2)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 7 open, 1 in_progress, 1 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: Healthy — advisor bootstrapped well, worker actively exploring main theorem.
**Observations**:
- Advisor task (u2o) completed successfully, created 8 tasks with good DAG structure:
  - 3 explore (sigma bounds, parity, main theorem)
  - 2 verify (sigma bounds review, parity review) — depend on explore tasks
  - 2 formalize (sigma bounds Lean, helper lemma setup) — properly chained
  - 1 verify (main theorem review) — depends on main explore
- Worker currently on erdos410v2-hme (explore main theorem, priority 1, large)
- Agent is doing deep mathematical reasoning — trying multiple approaches:
  - Smoothness argument (σ maps smooth numbers to smooth numbers)
  - σ(σ(m))/m → ∞ key lemma approach  
  - Parity analysis (σ(m) is even unless m is square or 2×square)
- Agent found counterexample to its own claim (σ(81)=121 is a perfect square) — showing intellectual honesty, not surrendering
- Agent references "Erdős's argument" — may know from training this is a hard problem, but framing hasn't caused surrender
- Unblocked tasks (4up, 9z0, l2y) waiting in queue at priority 2 — will run after hme finishes
- PROBLEM.md contained "conjecture" — sanitized to "theorem"
**Actions**:
1. Sanitized PROBLEM.md: "conjecture" → "theorem" to prevent difficulty leakage
**Watch next**:
- Does erdos410v2-hme complete or fail? If fail, check for surrender pattern
- If main theorem explore fails, the subsidiary tasks (sigma bounds, parity) are still valuable
- Watch for stale task if hme runs too long (it's a large task, give it time)
- After hme finishes, watch that 4up/9z0/l2y get picked up
- Strategic framing level: 1 (first attempt). Ready to escalate if needed.

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T21:32 UTC (Heartbeat #3)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 6 open, 1 in_progress, 3 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: Pipeline working correctly — explore→verify→reject→revision cycle in progress.
**Observations**:
- 2 tasks closed since last heartbeat: hme (explore main theorem) and l56 (verify main theorem)
- **Main theorem explore (hme) completed** → wrote proofs/main-theorem.md
- **Verification (l56) REJECTED it** with 7 critical gaps — good, rigorous review:
  - Parity stabilization arguments (Lemmas 3.2) not rigorous
  - Circular reasoning in v₂(aₖ) → ∞ proof (Lemma 5.3)
  - Prime accumulation hand-waved (Lemma 5.4-5.5)
  - Correct overall strategy kept (Phases 1-2 and 4)
- **Revision task (l3f) created and in_progress** — explore agent working on fixing gaps
  - Agent actively reasoning: trying ω(aₖ) → ∞ approach, Zsygmondy's theorem for new primes
  - Agent computed concrete examples (σ iterations from n=2), found ω fluctuates (e.g., σ₁₃(2) = 2¹²·7, ω=2)
  - Not stuck, not surrendering — doing genuine research
- Subsidiary tasks (4up, 9z0, l2y) still waiting at priority 2
- No defeatist artifacts (STATUS.md, etc.)
- No dangerous framing in worker-visible files
**Actions**: None — system healthy, pipeline functioning correctly.
**Watch next**:
- Does l3f (main theorem revision) succeed or fail?
- **KEY RISK**: If l3f fails again, consider NOT creating another revision immediately. Instead:
  - Prioritize subsidiary tasks (4up sigma bounds, 9z0 parity) to get verified literature flowing
  - Create advisor task to reassess strategy — maybe bottom-up (prove lemmas first) instead of top-down
- The subsidiary tasks would produce verified NL proofs faster, unblocking the formalize pipeline
- Strategic framing level: still 1 for main theorem. Subsidiaries haven't been attempted yet.

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T21:48 UTC (Heartbeat #4)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 6 open, 1 in_progress, 3 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: No change in task counts — revision task (l3f) still in_progress but making strong mathematical progress.
**Observations**:
- l3f log grew from 84 → 194 lines since last heartbeat — active, not stalled
- Agent found key corrected insight: σ(m) is odd iff **odd part** of m is a perfect square (broader than squares + 2×squares)
- Agent verified with concrete examples (σ(8)=15 was a contradiction under old characterization, resolved now)
- Agent proved 2^e - 1 is not a perfect square for e ≥ 2 (mod 4 argument)
- Agent working through parity stabilization: once a_k is even with non-square odd part, stays even
- Agent about to write the actual revised proof file
- Subsidiary tasks (4up, 9z0, l2y) still queued at p2 — waiting for l3f to finish
- No defeatist artifacts, no surrender signals
**Actions**: None — agent actively producing good mathematical work.
**Watch next**:
- l3f should complete soon (agent transitioning from reasoning to writing)
- After l3f: will a verify task be created for the revised proof? (Check that the pipeline continues)
- Subsidiary tasks (4up, 9z0, l2y) need to start flowing — they've been queued for 3 heartbeats
- If l3f is still in_progress next heartbeat, may be approaching stale territory

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T22:01 UTC (Heartbeat #5) — STRATEGIC PIVOT

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 7 open, 0 in_progress, 4 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: Pivoting from top-down to bottom-up strategy after human feedback.
**Observations**:
- Human flagged that monolithic main theorem approach is brute-force and probably not optimal
- l3f (revision) produced a second NL proof draft, better than v1 but still has soft spots:
  - Lemma 3.4 (non-square propagation) still hand-waves the key step
  - Lemma 5.4 (ω→∞) is intuitive but not airtight — "Mersenne factors introduce new primes" needs more formal treatment
  - The proof would likely fail verification again on these same issues
- This is a PATTERN: top-down produces proofs that look good at macro level but crumble under scrutiny at the same pressure points (parity stabilization, prime accumulation)
- Meanwhile, subsidiary tasks (sigma bounds, parity, Lean helpers) have been queued for 5 heartbeats untouched
- The Lean formalization hasn't even started — and that's where the hardest work is
**Actions**:
1. Closed l3f — stopping the top-down cycle
2. Created advisor task (l3a, priority 0) for strategic replanning:
   - Bottom-up: prove small lemmas first, verify, formalize, then compose
   - Consider alternative proof approaches (Catalan-Dickson, Gronwall bounds)
   - Account for Lean formalizability in the plan
**Watch next**:
- Does l3a (replanning) produce a good bottom-up task decomposition?
- Are subsidiary tasks (4up, 9z0, l2y) finally getting picked up?
- Key question for replanning: is ω(a_k)→∞ the right intermediate target, or should we use a different route?

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T22:10 UTC (Heartbeat #6)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 6 open, 1 in_progress, 4 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: Healthy — advisor replanning task (s3b) actively running, no stale tasks.
**Observations**:
- Advisor task s3b picked up immediately (started ~22:10), log at 75 lines and growing (file modified 2s ago)
- Agent reading all context files: PROBLEM.md, main-theorem.md, main-theorem-v2.md, Basic.lean, lakefile.lean
- Running `lake build` to verify compilation state — actively exploring project structure
- No new tasks closed since heartbeat #5 (expected — advisor is working)
- Existing subsidiary tasks (4up, 9z0, l2y, 5p8, ii5, n7i) still open and properly structured in DAG
- **Note**: s3b task says "l3a" in my previous notes but the actual task ID is s3b — this was the replanning task I created
- **Potential risk**: Advisor might create tasks that overlap with existing 4up (sigma bounds) and 9z0 (parity). Minor — can deduplicate next heartbeat if needed.
- Worker can only run 1 task at a time; subsidiary tasks wait behind s3b (p0 > p2). This is correct behavior.
**Actions**: None — system healthy, advisor actively working on strategic replan.
**Watch next**:
- Does s3b complete and produce a good bottom-up decomposition?
- How many new tasks created? Check for duplicates with existing 4up/9z0/l2y
- After s3b completes, do the explore tasks (4up, 9z0, and any new ones) start getting picked up?
- First priority should be getting verified NL proofs flowing to unblock the formalize pipeline

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T22:45 UTC (Heartbeat #8)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 1 (sigma-parity.md ✅) | Tasks: 8 open, 2 in_progress, 7 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: First verified proof achieved! Pipeline flowing. Bottom-up DAG fully seeded.
**Observations**:
- **FIRST VERIFIED PROOF**: sigma-parity.md (σ(n) odd iff n is square or 2×square) — explore→verify pipeline worked perfectly
  - 9z0 (explore) closed successfully, ii5 (verify) approved it, 2 git commits
- **s3b (advisor replanning) was STALE** — 477 lines, last modified 22:16, stalled for 25+ min. Computationally confirmed Lemma 3.4 is false but never created tasks. Recovered and closed.
- **l2y (Lean helpers formalize) ACTIVE** — 99 lines, exploring Mathlib API, writing helper statements. Good progress.
- **4up (sigma bounds explore) QUEUED** — marked in_progress but 8 lines (header only), not yet started. Worker handling l2y first.
- **Overseer created 5 new tasks** (replacing stalled advisor work):
  - fho: Even stability explore (p2, medium) → lbc: verify
  - uwa: ω(a_k)→∞ explore (p2, large) → h0a: verify
  - vp1: Main assembly explore (p3, medium, depends on fho+uwa) → 8xc: verify
- Full bottom-up pipeline now seeded: sigma-bounds → even-stability → ω-divergence → assembly
- Each hard task has detailed proof strategy hints (level 3-4 framing for even-stability warning about Lemma 3.4 being false, Zsygmondy hint for ω-divergence)
**Actions**:
1. Recovered stale s3b (advisor), then closed it
2. Created 5 tasks: fho, lbc, uwa, h0a, vp1, 8xc (3 explore + 3 verify) with proper DAG dependencies
**Watch next**:
- Does l2y (Lean helpers) complete? This unblocks n7i (formalize sigma bounds)
- Does 4up (sigma bounds explore) get picked up and produce proofs/sigma-lower-bounds.md?
- After 4up completes: 5p8 (verify) should run, then n7i (formalize) — this is the path to our first sorry reduction
- fho (even stability) is the next hard explore — watch for surrender or Lemma 3.4 trap
- ω-divergence (uwa) is the hardest task — may need framing adjustment after first attempt

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T22:26 UTC (Heartbeat #7)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 1 | Verified proofs: 0 | Tasks: 6 open, 1 in_progress, 4 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: Healthy — advisor replanning (s3b) deep in computational verification, no stale tasks.
**Observations**:
- s3b log grew from 75 → 477 lines since last heartbeat — very active, not stalled
- **Critical mathematical finding**: Agent computationally verified that Lemma 3.4 (non-square propagation under σ) is **FALSE** — 27 counterexamples in [2,500]. This was a pressure point in both draft proofs.
- Agent now empirically checking eventual even stability for small starting values
- This is exactly the right approach: ground-truth the proof architecture computationally before creating bottom-up tasks
- No new git commits (expected — advisor doesn't write code/proofs)
- No new tasks created yet (expected — still in analysis phase)
- Task counts unchanged: 6 open, 1 in_progress, 4 closed
- No stale tasks (worker actively processing s3b)
**Actions**: None — agent doing excellent pre-planning research.
**Watch next**:
- s3b should complete soon and create the bottom-up task decomposition
- KEY: the disproof of Lemma 3.4 means the existing parity task (9z0) may need updating — the standard characterization "σ(n) odd iff n is square or 2×square" is actually correct, but the *propagation* lemma (non-square odd part stays non-square under σ) is false. Watch whether the advisor accounts for this in task planning.
- If s3b still in_progress next heartbeat with log >800 lines, may be getting too deep — consider a stale check
- After s3b: expect a burst of new tasks, then rapid pickup of explore tasks

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-07T23:51 UTC (Heartbeat #9)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 4 real (1 main + 3 helper stubs) | Verified proofs: 1 (sigma-parity.md) | Drafts: 3 (even-stability, sigma-lower-bounds, main-theorem×2) | Tasks: 7 open, 1 in_progress, 9 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: Healthy — pipeline flowing, one minor fix applied.
**Observations**:
- **4up (explore sigma-lower-bounds)** actively working (log 52 lines, modified just now). Agent found an edge case: σ(n) ≥ (√n+1)² doesn't hold for prime squares (n=p²). Actively reasoning through the correct formulation. Good mathematical work.
- **fho (explore even-stability) COMPLETED** — produced proofs/eventual-even-stability.md (Draft ✏️, ~200 lines). Proof uses state machine approach (O-NS, O-S, E-NS, E-S). Has some soft spots: sparsity argument in Step 4 is hand-wavy, chain length bounds are empirical. Verify agent should catch these.
- **l2y (Lean helpers) COMPLETED** — Helpers.lean has 3 sorry-ed stubs (sigma_one_ge, sigma_one_even_ge, sigma_one_iterate_tendsto_atTop). Compiles clean. Good infrastructure.
- **lbc (verify even-stability) UNBLOCKED** — fho is closed. But title referenced wrong filename!
- **uwa (explore omega-divergence) UNBLOCKED** — no dependencies. This is the hardest remaining explore task.
- Sorry count rose from 1→4 because of helper stubs — this is intentional infrastructure, not regression.
- 5 tasks closed since last heartbeat (fho, l2y, and 3 earlier ones). Good throughput.
**Actions**:
1. **Fixed lbc title**: "proofs/even-stability.md" → "proofs/eventual-even-stability.md" (fho wrote to different filename than expected). Without this fix, the verify agent would look for a nonexistent file.
**Watch next**:
- Does 4up complete? It's working through an edge case but making progress. Should finish soon (small task).
- After 4up: 5p8 (verify), lbc (verify), uwa (explore) all at p2. Worker picks one. Ideal order: lbc/5p8 (small, quick) then uwa (large).
- **KEY PATH to first sorry reduction**: 4up → 5p8 → n7i (formalize sigma_one_ge, p1). This could close the first helper sorry.
- **RISK**: Even-stability proof (eventual-even-stability.md) has weak sparsity argument (Step 4). Verify agent may reject. If rejected, need targeted revision task fixing Steps 4-5 specifically.
- **RISK**: uwa (omega-divergence) is the mathematical crux. Watch for surrender or hand-waving on Zsygmondy's theorem application.
- Need to create formalize tasks for sigma_one_even_ge and sigma_one_iterate_tendsto_atTop after their NL proofs are verified.

## Heartbeat — 2026-02-08T00:11 UTC (Heartbeat #10)

**Metrics**: Sorry count: 3 real (1 main + 2 helper stubs) ↓ from 4 | Verified proofs: 2 (sigma-parity, sigma-lower-bounds) | Drafts: 1 (even-stability, Under review 🔍) | Tasks: 6 open, 1 in_progress, 13 closed | Build: ✅
**Status**: 🎉 FIRST SORRY CLOSED! Pipeline working end-to-end. Formalization proceeding.
**Observations**:
- **MILESTONE: sigma_one_ge sorry CLOSED** (n7i completed). The full explore→verify→formalize pipeline worked:
  - 4up (explore sigma-lower-bounds) ✅ → 5p8 (verify) ✅ → n7i (formalize) ✅ → sorry gone!
  - Clean Lean proof: unfold sigma_one_apply, extract {1,n} from divisors, sum_pair, sum_le_sum_of_subset, linarith. Elegant.
- **sigma-lower-bounds.md now Verified ✅** — 2nd verified proof.
- **lbc (verify even-stability) requested revision** — found 3 critical gaps (empirical chain bounds, probabilistic language, E-S transition bound). Expected from heartbeat #9. Created vt2 (revision task).
- **vt2 (revise even-stability)** actively working (log 62 lines, modified just now). Agent exploring growth-based escape argument — promising approach.
- **vt2 has no downstream verify task** — gap in pipeline! Fixed.
- **No formalize task for sigma_one_even_ge** — gap! sigma-lower-bounds already verified, sorry exists at Helpers.lean:40.
**Actions**:
1. Created **vit** (verify revised even-stability, p2, small, depends on vt2) — ensures revised proof gets reviewed.
2. Created **zrh** (formalize sigma_one_even_ge, p1, medium, no deps) — will close 2nd helper sorry. Pattern similar to n7i. Jumps queue at p1.
**Watch next**:
- Does vt2 complete successfully? Growth-based escape argument is the right approach. If it fails, may need a fundamentally different strategy for even-stability (perhaps: prove a weaker but still sufficient result).
- After vt2: zrh (p1) runs first → second sorry reduction. Then vit (p2) verifies the revised even-stability. Then uwa (p2, large) starts omega-divergence.
- **Remaining sorry reduction path**: zrh closes sigma_one_even_ge → 2 sorries left (main + iterate_tendsto). The iterate_tendsto sorry needs the full proof chain (needs ω→∞ which needs even-stability + omega-divergence).
- **Critical path to completion**: even-stability revision → omega-divergence → main assembly → formalize iterate + main theorem.
- Strategic framing level: 1 for formalization, 3-4 for exploration (detailed hints in uwa/vt2 descriptions).
