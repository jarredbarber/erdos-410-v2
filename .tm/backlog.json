Start by identifying what intermediate results are needed and creating explore tasks for the key mathematical steps. The proof should likely establish: (1) σ(n) ≥ n+1 for n ≥ 2, so the sequence σ_k(n) grows at least exponentially, (2) σ(n)/n is multiplicative and related to the abundancy index, (3) the growth rate of iterated σ is superexponential.

{"id":"erdos410v2-9z0","title":"Prove: σ(n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square or twice a perfect square","description":"Write to proofs/sigma-parity.md. This characterizes when σ(n) is odd vs even. The proof uses the multiplicativity of σ: σ(n) = ∏ σ(p^a) where p^a || n. For odd prime p, σ(p^a) = 1 + p + p² + ... + p^a has (a+1) terms; each term is odd, so σ(p^a) is odd iff a+1 is odd, i.e., a is even. For p = 2, σ(2^a) = 2^{a+1} - 1 is always odd. So σ(n) is odd iff every odd prime factor of n appears to an even power, i.e., the odd part of n is a perfect square. This means n = 2^b · m² with m odd, i.e., n is a square (b even) or twice a square (b odd). This result is needed to analyze the parity behavior of iterated σ.","state":"open","role":"explore","priority":2,"size":"small","type":"task","isSystem":false,"dependencies":[],"createdAt":"2026-02-07T21:08:41.308Z","updatedAt":"2026-02-07T21:08:41.308Z"}
{"id":"erdos410v2-hme","title":"Prove: for all n ≥ 2, σ_k(n)^{1/k} → ∞ as k → ∞","description":"Write to proofs/main-theorem.md. This is the central result. Define a_k = σ^k(n) for n ≥ 2. The proof has two phases:\n\nPHASE 1 (Divergence): σ(m) ≥ m + 1 for m ≥ 2, so a_k → ∞ monotonically. Moreover, for even m ≥ 2, σ(m) ≥ 3m/2, so whenever the iterates are even, they grow by at least 50%.\n\nPHASE 2 (Super-exponential growth): The key is to show the growth rate a_{k+1}/a_k increases without bound. The proof strategy:\n\n(a) For any prime p and n ≥ 2: σ(p) = p + 1, which is even (for p ≥ 3). So after hitting any prime, the next iterate is even.\n\n(b) For even m: σ(m)/m ≥ 3/2. This already gives exponential growth a_k ≥ C · (3/2)^{k/2}.\n\n(c) The ratio σ(m)/m = ∏_{p^a || m} (1 + 1/p + ... + 1/p^a). For m divisible by many small primes, this product is large: σ(m)/m ≥ ∏_{p | m} (1 + 1/p).\n\n(d) The key mechanism: σ maps 'smooth' numbers (those with many small prime factors) to other smooth numbers, and the smoothness tends to increase through iteration. This is because σ(p^a) = (p^{a+1}-1)/(p-1) introduces new prime factors.\n\n(e) To show a_k^{1/k} → ∞: show that for any C > 1, there exists K such that a_k > C^k for k ≥ K. This follows if σ(a_k)/a_k > C for all sufficiently large k.\n\nThe proof should provide a complete, rigorous argument.

The proof has six phases: (1) Divergence: σ(m) > m implies a_k → ∞; (2) Base exponential growth: σ(m) ≥ 3m/2 for even m, and a_k is eventually always even; (3) Exponent growth: the 2-adic valuation v₂(a_k) → ∞; (4) Small prime accumulation: via Fermat's little theorem, every odd prime q divides 2^(q-1) - 1, so as v₂(a_k) grows, Mersenne-like factors σ(2^a) = 2^(a+1) - 1 introduce all primes into the sequence; (5) Ratio divergence: since all small primes divide a_k for large k, the product ∏_{p|a_k}(1+1/p) ≥ ∏_{p≤B}(1+1/p) → ∞ by Mertens' theorem; (6) Conclusion: σ(a_k)/a_k → ∞ implies a_k^{1/k} → ∞. The proof notes that Lemma 5.5 (tracking prime persistence) requires careful analysis but the mechanism is clear: the 2-adic valuation growth continuously reintroduces small primes."}
