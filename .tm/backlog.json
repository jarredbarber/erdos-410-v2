So σ(n) is odd iff every odd prime factor of n appears to an even power, i.e., the odd part of n is a perfect square.

The proof has two phases:\n\nPHASE 1 (Divergence): σ(m) ≥ m + 1 for m ≥ 2, so a_k → ∞ monotonically. Moreover, for even m ≥ 2, σ(m) ≥ 3m/2, so whenever the iterates are even, they grow by at least 50%.\n\nPHASE 2 (Super-exponential growth): The key is to show the growth rate a_{k+1}/a_k increases without bound. The proof strategy:\n\n(a) For any prime p and n ≥ 2: σ(p) = p + 1, which is even (for p ≥ 3). So after hitting any prime, the next iterate is even.\n\n(b) For even m: σ(m)/m ≥ 3/2. This already gives exponential growth a_k ≥ C · (3/2)^{k/2}.\n\n(c) The ratio σ(m)/m = ∏_{p^a || m} (1 + 1/p + ... + 1/p^a). For m divisible by many small primes, this product is large: σ(m)/m ≥ ∏_{p | m} (1 + 1/p).\n\n(d) The key mechanism: σ maps 'smooth' numbers (those with many small prime factors) to other smooth numbers, and the smoothness tends to increase through iteration. This is because σ(p^a) = (p^{a+1}-1)/(p-1) introduces new prime factors.\n\n(e) To show a_k^{1/k} → ∞: show that for any C > 1, there exists K such that a_k > C^k for k ≥ K.

The proof contains several correct lemmas and important insights, but has critical gaps in the main argument that prevent verification.\n\n**VERIFIED COMPONENTS:**\n- Lemma 1.1: Growth bound σ(m) ≥ 3m/2 for even m — correctly proven ✅\n- Lemma 2.1: State transitions based on parity — correct, properly uses verified sigma-parity.md ✅  \n- Part 3 Steps 1 & 4: Perfect square propagation and density calculations — rigorous ✅\n\n**CRITICAL GAPS REQUIRING REVISION:**\n1. **Empirical verification substituted for proof**: Step 2 claims odd-square chains are short based on computational checks (t ≤ 100), not mathematical proof. No justification that longer chains don't exist for larger values.\n\n2. **Probabilistic language in deterministic proof**: Step 5 uses density/probability arguments but the sequence is deterministic. Sparsity doesn't automatically imply finitely many visits—needs proof that sequence dynamics prevent infinite returns.\n\n3. **Incomplete E-S analysis**: Step 3's claim about ≤3 step returns relies on empirical verification (v ≤ 19, s ≤ 99) without mathematical justification.\n\n**ACTIONS TAKEN:**\n- Updated file status to 'Under review 🔍'\n- Added detailed review notes to proofs/eventual-even-stability.md\n- Created follow-up task erdos410v2-vt2 for explore agent to revise the proof with rigorous arguments replacing empirical verification\n\nThe proof framework is sound and the approach is promising.

{"id":"erdos410v2-uwa","title":"Prove: For the sequence a_0 = n ≥ 2, a_{k+1} = σ(a_k), the number of distinct prime factors ω(a_k) → ∞ as k → ∞.\n\nApproach: Use the following chain of reasoning:\n1. From the sigma lower bounds (proofs/sigma-lower-bounds.md), σ(m) ≥ m+1 for m ≥ 2, so a_k is strictly increasing, hence a_k → ∞.\n2. From even stability (proofs/even-stability.md), a_k is eventually always even. So for large k, a_k = 2^{e_k} · m_k where e_k ≥ 1.\n3. Key step: σ(2^e · m) = (2^{e+1}-1) · σ(m) for odd m. If m has prime factorization p_1^{a_1}···p_r^{a_r}, then σ(m) = ∏σ(p_i^{a_i}), and each σ(p_i^{a_i}) = 1+p_i+···+p_i^{a_i} introduces factors not all of which are among the p_i.\n4. Show that σ(m)/m = ∏(1+1/p_i+···+1/p_i^{a_i}) and if ω(m) stays bounded, this ratio is bounded, contradicting σ(m) ≥ 3m/2 applied iteratively (which gives exponential growth).\n5. More precisely: if ω(a_k) ≤ B for all k, then σ(a_k)/a_k ≤ ∏_{p ≤ P_B} p/(p-1) for some fixed set of primes, giving σ(a_k) ≤ C·a_k for a constant C. But iterating σ gives a_k ≥ (3/2)^k·a_0 (by even bounds), while a_k ≤ exp(C'·k) for bounded ω — these are compatible. Need a sharper argument.\n6. Alternative: Use Gronwall's theorem: lim sup σ(n)/(n ln ln n) = e^γ. If ω(a_k) ≤ B, then a_k is B-smooth-in-primes, meaning a_k's prime support is within {p_1,...,p_B}. For such numbers, σ(n)/n ≤ ∏_{i=1}^B p_i/(p_i-1). This caps σ(a_k)/a_k, but a_k grows at least as fast as (3/2)^k. Since σ(a_{k+1})/a_{k+1} is also bounded by the same constant, and a_{k+1} = σ(a_k), we get a_{k+1}/a_k = σ(a_k)/a_k ≤ C. This means a_k ≤ C^k · a_0, which is consistent with (3/2)^k growth.\n7. The real argument: new primes must enter. σ(p^a) = 1+p+...+p^a. By Zsygmondy's theorem, for p^{a+1}-1, there exists a primitive prime divisor q ∤ p^j-1 for j < a+1, so q is a new prime not equal to p. More concretely, show that the Mersenne factor (2^{e+1}-1) in σ(2^e·m) eventually introduces primes outside the support of m. Then each iteration adds at least one new prime infinitely often.\n\nWrite to proofs/omega-divergence.md.
