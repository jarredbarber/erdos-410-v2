[2026-02-07T22:10:12.070Z] 📌 Processing task: erdos410v2-s3b - STRATEGIC REPLANNING: Bottom-up decomposition for Erdős 410

## Context
Two monolithic NL proof attempts exist in proofs/ (main-theorem.md and main-theorem-v2.md), both Draft status. A previous verification identified 7 critical gaps in v1; v2 improved some but the same pressure points remain:
- Lemma 3.4 (non-square propagation under σ) hand-waves the critical step
- Lemma 5.3-5.4 (ω(a_k) → ∞) lacks rigorous justification

## Your Mission
Design a BOTTOM-UP task plan. Do NOT create another monolithic explore task for the full theorem. Instead:

1. Read the existing drafts (proofs/main-theorem.md, proofs/main-theorem-v2.md) to identify the proof architecture
2. Read the sorry in Erdos/Basic.lean to understand the Lean formalization target
3. Break the proof into INDEPENDENT lemmas, each provable in isolation
4. Create explore tasks for each lemma (smallest/easiest first)
5. Chain verify tasks after each explore
6. Plan formalize tasks that decompose the main sorry into sub-lemmas

## Key Constraints
- Each explore task should prove ONE lemma, written to a separate file in proofs/
- Easy lemmas first (σ(m)≥m+1, σ(even)≥3m/2, parity characterization)
- Hard lemmas later with dependencies on easy ones
- The existing drafts are REFERENCE MATERIAL, not solutions — the individual lemma proofs must be self-contained and rigorous
- Create at least 5 explore tasks, prioritized 1-3 by difficulty
- For each explore task, create a corresponding verify task depending on it
- Create formalize tasks for setting up the Lean proof skeleton with sorry holes for each lemma

## Strategy Notes  
The overall proof structure in the drafts is sound: (1) σ(m)≥3m/2 for even m, (2) eventual even stability, (3) ω(a_k)→∞, (4) combine via Gronwall/prime product bounds. The weak points are (2) and (3). Focus explore resources there.

[2026-02-07T22:43:30.021Z]    Summary: Proved σ(n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square or twice a perfect square. Published to proofs/sigma-parity.md
[2026-02-07T22:43:30.021Z]    Details: Confidence: Certain. The proof proceeds in 5 clean steps: (1) σ(2^a) = 2^{a+1} - 1 is always odd; (2) for odd prime p, σ(p^a) is a sum of (a+1) odd terms, so odd iff a is even; (3) by multiplicativity, σ(n) is odd iff every odd prime factor appears to an even power; (4) this is equivalent to the odd part of n being a perfect square; (5) odd part being a square is equivalent to n being a square (when v₂(n) is even) or twice a square (when v₂(n) is odd). Verified against 10 small cases. All steps are fully rigorous with no gaps.

📊 Task erdos410v2-ii5 completed:
[2026-02-07T22:44:46.363Z]    Summary: Approved — proofs/sigma-parity.md
[2026-02-07T22:44:46.363Z]    Details: The proof that σ(n) is odd iff n is a perfect square or twice a perfect square is correct, rigorous, and complete. All key steps verified:

✅ Step 1: σ(2^a) is always odd — correct via formula 2^(a+1) - 1
✅ Step 2: For odd prime p, σ(p^a) is odd iff a is even — correct via parity of sum of odd numbers
✅ Step 3: Multiplicativity argument properly combines the cases
✅ Step 4: Correctly relates condition to odd part being a square
✅ Step 5: Bidirectional proof of equivalence with "square or twice square" — both directions verified

Edge cases handled: n=1, powers of 2, odd primes, general case via multiplicativity. Small-case verification (n=1 through 10) provides additional confidence. No hidden assumptions, no circular dependencies. File status updated to Verified ✅.

📊 Task erdos410v2-4up completed:
[2026-02-07T23:53:53.511Z]    Summary: Proved three basic lower bounds for σ(n). Published to proofs/sigma-lower-bounds.md
[2026-02-07T23:53:53.511Z]    Details: Confidence: Certain. All three bounds are elementary and fully rigorous.

(1) σ(n) ≥ n + 1 for n ≥ 2: immediate from 1 and n being distinct divisors.

(2) For composite n ≥ 4: proved σ(n) ≥ n + d + n/d + 1 ≥ (√n + 1)² when n is NOT a prime square (via four distinct divisors 1, d, n/d, n and AM-GM). Noted honestly that the (√n + 1)² bound fails for n = p² (e.g., σ(4) = 7 < 9); in the prime square case σ(n) = n + √n + 1 exactly. Proved the uniform bound σ(n) ≥ n + √n + 1 for ALL composite n.

(3) σ(n) ≥ 3n/2 for even n ≥ 2: gave two proofs — one by divisor counting (1, 2, n/2, n), one by multiplicativity (σ(2^a)·σ(m) ≥ (3/2)·2^a·m). Equality only at n = 2.

All claims numerically verified for n up to 100.

📊 Task erdos410v2-5p8 completed:
[2026-02-07T23:55:42.772Z]    Summary: Approved ✅ — proofs/sigma-lower-bounds.md
[2026-02-07T23:55:42.772Z]    Details: The proof has been thoroughly reviewed and verified. All three bounds are proven with full mathematical rigor:

**Bound 1** (σ(n) ≥ n+1 for n ≥ 2): Trivial and correct - uses the fact that 1 and n are always distinct divisors.

**Bound 2** (Composite bounds): Multiple results proven correctly:
- Lemma 2.1 establishes d ≤ √n for smallest prime factor d (proof by contradiction is sound)
- Lemma 2.2 identifies four distinct divisors when n ≠ d², yielding σ(n) ≥ n + d + n/d + 1
- Corollary 2.3 correctly applies AM-GM to strengthen this to σ(n) ≥ (√n+1)² for non-prime-squares
- Lemma 2.4 handles the prime square case exactly: σ(p²) = n + √n + 1
- Theorem 2.5 combines both cases for uniform bound σ(n) ≥ n + √n + 1

**Bound 3** (σ(n) ≥ 3n/2 for even n): Two independent proofs provided:
- Proof A: Elementary divisor counting with explicit case analysis (n=2, n=4, n≥6)
- Proof B: Elegant multiplicativity argument using σ(2^a·m) = σ(2^a)·σ(m)

All edge cases handled, all quantifiers properly scoped, no hidden assumptions detected. The proof is self-contained and complete. File status updated to Verified ✅.
