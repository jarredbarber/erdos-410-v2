[2026-02-07T22:10:12.070Z] 📌 Processing task: erdos410v2-s3b - STRATEGIC REPLANNING: Bottom-up decomposition for Erdős 410

## Context
Two monolithic NL proof attempts exist in proofs/ (main-theorem.md and main-theorem-v2.md), both Draft status. A previous verification identified 7 critical gaps in v1; v2 improved some but the same pressure points remain:
- Lemma 3.4 (non-square propagation under σ) hand-waves the critical step
- Lemma 5.3-5.4 (ω(a_k) → ∞) lacks rigorous justification

## Your Mission
Design a BOTTOM-UP task plan. Do NOT create another monolithic explore task for the full theorem. Instead:

1. Read the existing drafts (proofs/main-theorem.md, proofs/main-theorem-v2.md) to identify the proof architecture
2. Read the sorry in Erdos/Basic.lean to understand the Lean formalization target
3. Break the proof into INDEPENDENT lemmas, each provable in isolation
4. Create explore tasks for each lemma (smallest/easiest first)
5. Chain verify tasks after each explore
6. Plan formalize tasks that decompose the main sorry into sub-lemmas

## Key Constraints
- Each explore task should prove ONE lemma, written to a separate file in proofs/
- Easy lemmas first (σ(m)≥m+1, σ(even)≥3m/2, parity characterization)
- Hard lemmas later with dependencies on easy ones
- The existing drafts are REFERENCE MATERIAL, not solutions — the individual lemma proofs must be self-contained and rigorous
- Create at least 5 explore tasks, prioritized 1-3 by difficulty
- For each explore task, create a corresponding verify task depending on it
- Create formalize tasks for setting up the Lean proof skeleton with sorry holes for each lemma

## Strategy Notes  
The overall proof structure in the drafts is sound: (1) σ(m)≥3m/2 for even m, (2) eventual even stability, (3) ω(a_k)→∞, (4) combine via Gronwall/prime product bounds. The weak points are (2) and (3). Focus explore resources there.

[2026-02-07T22:43:30.021Z]    Summary: Proved σ(n) is odd if and only if n is a perfect square or twice a perfect square. Published to proofs/sigma-parity.md
[2026-02-07T22:43:30.021Z]    Details: Confidence: Certain. The proof proceeds in 5 clean steps: (1) σ(2^a) = 2^{a+1} - 1 is always odd; (2) for odd prime p, σ(p^a) is a sum of (a+1) odd terms, so odd iff a is even; (3) by multiplicativity, σ(n) is odd iff every odd prime factor appears to an even power; (4) this is equivalent to the odd part of n being a perfect square; (5) odd part being a square is equivalent to n being a square (when v₂(n) is even) or twice a square (when v₂(n) is odd). Verified against 10 small cases. All steps are fully rigorous with no gaps.

📊 Task erdos410v2-ii5 completed:
[2026-02-07T22:44:46.363Z]    Summary: Approved — proofs/sigma-parity.md
[2026-02-07T22:44:46.363Z]    Details: The proof that σ(n) is odd iff n is a perfect square or twice a perfect square is correct, rigorous, and complete. All key steps verified:

✅ Step 1: σ(2^a) is always odd — correct via formula 2^(a+1) - 1
✅ Step 2: For odd prime p, σ(p^a) is odd iff a is even — correct via parity of sum of odd numbers
✅ Step 3: Multiplicativity argument properly combines the cases
✅ Step 4: Correctly relates condition to odd part being a square
✅ Step 5: Bidirectional proof of equivalence with "square or twice square" — both directions verified

Edge cases handled: n=1, powers of 2, odd primes, general case via multiplicativity. Small-case verification (n=1 through 10) provides additional confidence. No hidden assumptions, no circular dependencies. File status updated to Verified ✅.
