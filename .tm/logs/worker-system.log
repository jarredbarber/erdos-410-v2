[2026-02-07T20:59:46.428Z] 📌 Processing task: erdos410v2-u2o - Initial gap analysis and research planning: analyze the main theorem sorry in Erdos/Basic.lean, decompose the proof into sub-goals, and create explore/formalize tasks. The theorem states that for all n > 1, the iterated sum-of-divisors σ_k(n)^{1/k} → ∞. Start by identifying what intermediate results are needed and creating explore tasks for the key mathematical steps. The proof should likely establish: (1) σ(n) ≥ n+1 for n ≥ 2, so the sequence σ_k(n) grows at least exponentially, (2) σ(n)/n is multiplicative and related to the abundancy index, (3) the growth rate of iterated σ is superexponential. Create explore tasks for the most promising proof components.

So σ(n) is odd iff every odd prime factor of n appears to an even power, i.e., the odd part of n is a perfect square.

  -d "Write to proofs/main-theorem.md. This is the central result. Define a_k = σ^k(n) for n ≥ 2. The proof has two phases:

PHASE 1 (Divergence): σ(m) ≥ m + 1 for m ≥ 2, so a_k → ∞ monotonically. Moreover, for even m ≥ 2, σ(m) ≥ 3m/2, so whenever the iterates are even, they grow by at least 50%.

PHASE 2 (Super-exponential growth): The key is to show the growth rate a_{k+1}/a_k increases without bound. The proof strategy:

(a) For any prime p and n ≥ 2: σ(p) = p + 1, which is even (for p ≥ 3). So after hitting any prime, the next iterate is even.

(b) For even m: σ(m)/m ≥ 3/2. This already gives exponential growth a_k ≥ C · (3/2)^{k/2}.

(c) The ratio σ(m)/m = ∏_{p^a || m} (1 + 1/p + ... + 1/p^a). For m divisible by many small primes, this product is large: σ(m)/m ≥ ∏_{p | m} (1 + 1/p).

(d) The key mechanism: σ maps 'smooth' numbers (those with many small prime factors) to other smooth numbers, and the smoothness tends to increase through iteration. This is because σ(p^a) = (p^{a+1}-1)/(p-1) introduces new prime factors.

(e) To show a_k^{1/k} → ∞: show that for any C > 1, there exists K such that a_k > C^k for k ≥ K. This follows if σ(a_k)/a_k > C for all sufficiently large k.

The proof should provide a complete, rigorous argument. References to proofs/sigma-lower-bounds.md and proofs/sigma-parity.md may be used for supporting lemmas."

**Lean Status**: Project compiles with 1 sorry at Erdos/Basic.lean:8 (erdos_410). Available Mathlib API: sigma_apply, sigma_one_apply, isMultiplicative_sigma, sigma_pos, sigma_apply_prime_pow.

**Literature Status**: proofs/ directory initialized with README.md. No proofs written yet.

## Proof Decomposition

The main theorem (σ_k(n)^{1/k} → ∞ for n ≥ 2) decomposes into:

1. **σ(n) ≥ n + 1 for n ≥ 2** (elementary, from divisors {1, n} plus at least one more)
2. **σ(n) ≥ (√n + 1)² for composite n** (from AM-GM on proper divisor pair d, n/d)
3. **σ(n) ≥ 3n/2 for even n** (from multiplicativity: σ(2m) = 3σ(m) for m odd)
4. **Parity of σ**: σ(n) odd iff n is square or 2·square (from multiplicativity)
5. **Super-exponential growth**: key mechanism is that iterates acquire more small prime factors, increasing σ(m)/m via ∏(1+1/p)

1. sigma(n) >= n + 1 for n >= 2 (elementary)
2. sigma(n) >= (sqrt(n) + 1)^2 for composite n (AM-GM on divisor pair)
3. sigma(n) >= 3n/2 for even n (multiplicativity)
4. Parity: sigma(n) odd iff n is square or 2*square
5. Super-exponential growth: iterates acquire small prime factors, increasing sigma(m)/m

[2026-02-07T21:10:41.739Z]    Summary: Created 8 tasks: 3 explore, 2 verify, 2 formalize, 1 advisor (closed). Decomposed proof into three tracks with proper dependency chains.
[2026-02-07T21:10:41.739Z]    Details: ## Gap Analysis

**Lean state**: 1 sorry at Erdos/Basic.lean:8 (`erdos_410`). Project compiles cleanly. Mathlib provides `sigma_apply`, `sigma_one_apply`, `isMultiplicative_sigma`, `sigma_pos`, `sigma_apply_prime_pow`.

**Literature state**: proofs/ directory initialized, no proofs written yet.

## Proof Decomposition

The main theorem σ_k(n)^{1/k} → ∞ decomposes into:

1. **σ(n) ≥ n+1 for n ≥ 2** — from 1 and n being divisors (elementary)
2. **σ(n) ≥ (√n+1)² for composite n** — from AM-GM on a proper divisor pair
3. **σ(n) ≥ 3n/2 for even n** — from multiplicativity of σ
4. **Parity characterization** — σ(n) odd iff n is square or twice square
5. **Super-exponential growth** — iterates accumulate small prime factors, increasing σ(m)/m via ∏(1+1/p) which diverges

## Task DAG (3 independent tracks)

**Track 1 (bounds → formalize)**:
- erdos410v2-4up (explore: σ bounds) → erdos410v2-5p8 (verify) → erdos410v2-n7i (formalize in Lean)

**Track 2 (parity)**:
- erdos410v2-9z0 (explore: σ parity) → erdos410v2-ii5 (verify)

**Track 3 (main theorem)**:
- erdos410v2-hme (explore: main proof) → erdos410v2-l56 (verify)

**Parallel**: erdos410v2-l2y (formalize: Lean scaffolding with sorry stubs)

## Current sorry count: 1
## Unblocked tasks: 4 (erdos410v2-4up, erdos410v2-9z0, erdos410v2-hme, erdos410v2-l2y)

## Next steps after verification
Once main-theorem.md is verified, create a formalize task to close the erdos_410 sorry using the full proof chain.
