  "status": "completed",
  "summary": "Formalized `padicValNat_finset_prod` in `Erdos/FactorPump.lean`. lake build succeeds.",
  "details": "The proof proceeds by induction on the finset `s`. The base case is trivial. For the inductive step, I used `Finset.prod_insert` and `Finset.sum_insert` to separate the element `a`. Then `padicValNat.mul` was applied to decompose the valuation of the product into the sum of valuations. The inductive hypothesis was applied to the remaining product. The non-zero assumptions required by `padicValNat.mul` were satisfied by the hypothesis `hf` and `Finset.prod_ne_zero_iff`."
